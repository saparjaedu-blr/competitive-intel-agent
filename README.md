## 🛠 Setup

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saparjaedu-blr/competitive-intel-agent.git
cd competitive-intel-agent

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your API keys — see Environment Variables section below
```

### 3. Set up Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project (e.g. `CompIntelAgent`)
3. Enable **Google Drive API** and **Google Docs API**
4. OAuth consent screen → External → add your email as a Test User
5. Credentials → Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID → Desktop App → download as `credentials.json`
6. Place `credentials.json` in the project root
7. First run opens a browser for auth → saves `token.json` automatically

### 4. Gmail App Password

1. Enable 2-factor auth on your Google account
2. Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. Generate for "Mail" → paste the 16-char password into `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in `.env`

### 5. Google Doc Scrapbook

Create a folder in Google Drive (e.g. `Competitor Scrapbook`). Inside it, create **one Google Doc per competitor** — the filename should match the vendor name you configure in the app:

```
📁 Competitor Scrapbook/          ← copy this folder's ID into GOOGLE_DOC_SCRAPBOOK_ID
    📄 OpenAI                     ← tabs: "Models", "API Features", "Pricing", "Roadmap"
    📄 Anthropic                  ← tabs: "Claude Models", "Safety", "Enterprise"
    📄 Google DeepMind
```

Each doc supports **multiple tabs** (e.g. AI Features, Pricing, Integrations). The agent reads all tabs and extracts all inline images automatically using GPT-4o Vision.

Copy the **folder ID** from its URL:
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID_HERE
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

### 6. Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🏗 Architecture

### LangGraph Pipeline

```
web_scraper ──► youtube_scraper ──► gdoc_reader
                                         │
                                    synthesizer          ← GPT-4o Vision (text + images)
                                         │
                                    diff_engine          ← semantic delta vs last run
                                         │
                                    report_writer ──► SQLite + Google Drive (if enabled)
```

Each node streams its completion back to the UI in real time — the progress bar advances and a live synthesis preview appears as GPT-4o processes each vendor.
